# The redirect is useful because it enables us to monitor the xml that
# flows from client and from server. Set the url to point to the 
# xAPSWS URL of the server. The WS-client must use this URL:
# http://<hostname>:<port>/xapsws/redirect
redirect-url = "http://localhost/xapsws/services/xAPSWS"

# --- Database --- 

db {
  # xAPS database configuration. Format <user>/<password>@<jdbc-url>
  xaps {
    url = "xaps/xaps@jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/xaps"
  }
  # Syslog database configuration.
  # Default is to place syslog on the same database as xaps. However, you may
  # specify a database placed elsewhere, to relieve the xaps database of excessive
  # load from syslogging.
  syslog = ${db.xaps}
}
