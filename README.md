# freeacs
freeacs with maven and jetty

This is a work in progress. The plan is to convert the previous manual build and deployment process to a completely automated maven build backed with travis CI etc.

If you want to help, for the repo and open a pull request.

To run any of the web applications, run ```mvn jetty:run```. But you need a mysql server running and you need to install the sql scripts.
