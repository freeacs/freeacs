/***
 * TFTPPacket is an abstract class encapsulating the functionality common
 * to the 5 types of TFTP packets.  It also provides a static factory
 * method that will create the correct TFTP packet instance from a
 * datagram.  This relieves the programmer from having to figure out what
 * kind of TFTP packet is contained in a datagram and create it himself.
 * <p>
 * Details regarding the TFTP protocol and the format of TFTP packets can
 * be found in RFC 783.  But the point of these classes is to keep you
 * from having to worry about the internals.  Additionally, only very
 * few people should have to care about any of the TFTPPacket classes
 * or derived classes.  Almost all users should only be concerned with the
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.tftp.TFTPClient} class
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.tftp.TFTPClient#receiveFile receiveFile()}
 * and
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.tftp.TFTPClient#sendFile sendFile()}
 * methods.
