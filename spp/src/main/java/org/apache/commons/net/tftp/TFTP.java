/***
 * The TFTP class exposes a set of methods to allow you to deal with the TFTP
 * protocol directly, in case you want to write your own TFTP client or server.
 * However, almost every user should only be concerend with the
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.DatagramSocketClient#open open() }, and
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.DatagramSocketClient#close close() }, methods.
 * Additionally,the a
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.DatagramSocketClient#setDefaultTimeout
 * setDefaultTimeout() } method may be of importance for performance tuning.
 * <p>
 * Details regarding the TFTP protocol and the format of TFTP packets can be
 * found in RFC 783. But the point of these classes is to keep you from having
 * to worry about the internals.
