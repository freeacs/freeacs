/***
 * This exception is used to indicate that the reply from a server
 * could not be interpreted.  Most of the NetComponents classes attempt
 * to be as lenient as possible when receiving server replies.  Many
 * server implementations deviate from IETF protocol specifications, making
 * it necessary to be as flexible as possible.  However, there will be
 * certain situations where it is not possible to continue an operation
 * because the server reply could not be interpreted in a meaningful manner.
 * In these cases, a MalformedServerReplyException should be thrown.
