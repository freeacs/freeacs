/***
 * The DatagramSocketClient provides the basic operations that are required
 * of client objects accessing datagram sockets.  It is meant to be
 * subclassed to avoid having to rewrite the same code over and over again
 * to open a socket, close a socket, set timeouts, etc.  Of special note
 * is the {@link #setDatagramSocketFactory  setDatagramSocketFactory }
 * method, which allows you to control the type of DatagramSocket the
 * DatagramSocketClient creates for network communications.  This is
 * especially useful for adding things like proxy support as well as better
 * support for applets.  For
 * example, you could create a
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.DatagramSocketFactory}
 *  that
 * requests browser security capabilities before creating a socket.
 * All classes derived from DatagramSocketClient should use the
 * {@link #_socketFactory_  _socketFactory_ } member variable to
 * create DatagramSocket instances rather than instantiating
 * them by directly invoking a constructor.  By honoring this contract
 * you guarantee that a user will always be able to provide his own
 * Socket implementations by substituting his own SocketFactory.
