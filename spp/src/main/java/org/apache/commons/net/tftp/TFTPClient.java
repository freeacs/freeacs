/***
 * The TFTPClient class encapsulates all the aspects of the TFTP protocol
 * necessary to receive and send files through TFTP.  It is derived from
 * the {@link org.apache.commons.net.tftp.TFTP} because
 * it is more convenient than using aggregation, and as a result exposes
 * the same set of methods to allow you to deal with the TFTP protocol
 * directly.  However, almost every user should only be concerend with the
 * the {@link org.apache.commons.net.DatagramSocketClient#open  open() },
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.DatagramSocketClient#close  close() },
 * {@link #sendFile  sendFile() }, and
 * {@link #receiveFile  receiveFile() } methods.  Additionally, the
 * {@link #setMaxTimeouts  setMaxTimeouts() } and
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.DatagramSocketClient#setDefaultTimeout setDefaultTimeout() }
 *  methods may be of importance for performance
 * tuning.
 * <p>
 * Details regarding the TFTP protocol and the format of TFTP packets can
 * be found in RFC 783.  But the point of these classes is to keep you
 * from having to worry about the internals.
