/***
 * A class used to signify the occurrence of an error in the creation of
 * a TFTP packet.  It is not declared final so that it may be subclassed
 * to identify more specific errors.  You would only want to do this if
 * you were building your own TFTP client or server on top of the
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.tftp.TFTP}
 * class if you
 * wanted more functionality than the
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.tftp.TFTPClient#receiveFile receiveFile()}
 * and
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.tftp.TFTPClient#sendFile sendFile()}
 * methods provide.
