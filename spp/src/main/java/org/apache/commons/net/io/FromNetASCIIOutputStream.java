/***
 * This class wraps an output stream, replacing all occurrences
 * of &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; (carriage return followed by a linefeed),
 * which is the NETASCII standard for representing a newline, with the
 * local line separator representation.  You would use this class to
 * implement ASCII file transfers requiring conversion from NETASCII.
 * <p>
 * Because of the translation process, a call to <code>flush()</code> will
 * not flush the last byte written if that byte was a carriage
 * return.  A call to {@link #close  close() }, however, will
 * flush the carriage return.
