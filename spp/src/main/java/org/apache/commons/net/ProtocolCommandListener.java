/***
 * There exists a large class of IETF protocols that work by sending an
 * ASCII text command and arguments to a server, and then receiving an
 * ASCII text reply.  For debugging and other purposes, it is extremely
 * useful to log or keep track of the contents of the protocol messages.
 * The ProtocolCommandListener interface coupled with the
 * {@link ProtocolCommandEvent} class facilitate this process.
 * <p>
 * To receive ProtocolCommandEvents, you merely implement the
 * ProtocolCommandListener interface and register the class as a listener
 * with a ProtocolCommandEvent source such as
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPClient}.
