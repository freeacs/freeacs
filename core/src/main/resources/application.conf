# In general, read the doc about the groups/jobs and the core server.

# Old completed jobs must be removed from the job system, because it will
# decrease performance in the long run to keep them there. Hence this value.
# In hours. Default is 48.
completed.job.limit = 1

# The syslog table must not grow too enormous, so we must delete old rows after
# some time. However, some rows/entries are more interesting than others time. To
# address this need Freeacs supports the deletion of syslog entries based on severity
# of the entry. In addition it is possible to set a deletion limit for a specific
# syslog event (must be set in Freeacs Shell/Web). When conflict between the severity
# limit and the event limit occurs, the highest value will "win".

# All values are stated as a number of days to save before deletion.
# Default 90 days for severity 0 (Emergency)
syslog.severity.0.limit = 90
# Default 90 days for severity 1 (Alert)
syslog.severity.1.limit = 90
# Default 90 days for severity 2 (Critical)

# Syslog cleanup is very important to keep the database size in check.
# If activated it will only run in the first hour after midnight.
# There are three modes:
#
# normal : Will delete according to the deletion rules defined above as
# well as the syslog-event deletion limits.
#
# comprehensive: Will delete using the same rules as in normal mode.
# However, the normal mode will not check the entire database, only the
# most recent days. Comprehensive will check the whole database, but
# this is only necessary if you suspect a lot of garbage have been
# gathered in the syslog database.
#
# off: Will not run the deletion routine. Never set this is production
# other than for short tests of this module.
#
# Default mode is normal.

# If the server is a staging server (a special type of server only used by Ping
# Communications), then all UNCONFIRMED_FAILED jobs will be set to COMPLETED_OK
# after one hour, because the units are assumed to be staged to another
# provisioning server. Specify true/false. Default is false.
staging = false


# --- Reports ---
# Fusion will always produce Unit-reports (counting units). In addition
# you may specify "Basic" (to get Group/Job/Syslog/Prov-reports) and
# "Pingcom" to get VoIP/Hardware-reports. The latter is only possible if
# provisioning NPA201E, NPA101E, RGW208EN or IAD208AN devices.
# Default is "Basic".
# Examples:
# reports =
# reports = Basic
# reports = Basic, Pingcom

reports = Basic

# --- Shell Script Daemon ---

# This is the maximum number of shell script daemons pr user.
# The daemon is used whenever a script execution is requested, which
# can come from a Job, Trigger, SyslogEvent, Web (Script Execution Page)
# and Shell (setexecution command). Default size is 4.
shellscript.poolsize = 4

# The number of days to keep old script executions, both executed, failed
# or not started. Default is 7.
shellscript.limit = 7
