v1.74.31 (2013-05-23)
- bug: Less, Less-than, Greater and Greater-than searches in groups were not handled if value contained wildcards - they will now automatically be
converted to a standard string-search without any wildcard matching. This would perhaps not be understood by the user (since wildcards are applied),
but using wildcards and LT, LE, GT and GE doesn't make sense for MySQL anyway.
v1.74.30 (2013-05-21)
- bug: Unittype.toString() failed if unittypeParameters or profiles object where null - something that never should happen, but still...
- ref: Improved ensureValidSystemParameters function in Unittype  - more logging - hope to see what fails in discovery

- ref: removed some System.out.println() from TestDB (was seen in Shell command output)
v1.74.13 (2013-04-03)
- bug: refresh operations on Files, Jobs, Groups and in DBI did not handle if some object was allowed for this user (=null). 
- bug: refreshGroups created! group if it was not found - negating the permission system - also caused a bug in refreshGroupParameters 
v1.74.12 (2013-04-02)
- bug: Groups.addOrChangeParameter did not handle unknown id correct - always added - now compares with existing parameters and will not create two equal group parameters

- del: Removed references to OPP-pattern for creation of units
v1.74.0 (2013-03-01)
- ref: SyslogClient is improved a lot, lots of new methods to make simple logging to Syslog possible
- ref: Added logging to SyslogServer (not using SyslogAppender, simply posting a UDP-packet directly to the server). This
       requires that a syslog server is always present on localhost:9116 (which is acceptable). The logging is done from
       all XAPSUnit-method which changes the unit/unit-parameter 
- del: Removed SyslogAppender/LogContext. These classes was introduced in v1.46.1, but have since proved problematic and caused
       a lot of headache. Examples are:
       	- bugs within SyslogAppender, can be hard to track down
       	- context (facility, facility-version, user, etc) had to be set using Thread-context, causing unreadble code, lot of reset-statements
       	- most logging should not be sent to syslog anyway 
       	- debug-mode could cause massive load on the syslog database
       	- direct writing to syslog table bypassed the syslog server + syslog event processing
		- we've started to send messages to the syslog server, instead of writing to the table - this is a better solution for those
			few selected places where we really want to log from our internal modules into syslog
- del: Removed everything regarding the TR-reports. This feature was introduced in v1.54.4, but has never been used. In also
       caused a lot of unnecessary logic and complications:
       	- We never had a chance to actually test it (in 2.5 years!)
       	- It was doubtful whether a device could actually support this
       	- The setup of a TR-report was pretty complicated, to understand it's inner workings if something failed would be impossible (for customers)
       	- We had to maintain an extra flag (Monitor-flag)
       	- We had to maintain a set of special parameters (Command-parameters) which changed value upon setting the to the device (violation of standard procedure)
       	For this reasons and others as well, I've decided to remove all of it. Good riddance!

- Added nextPII to job-object, necessary to compute correct Periodic Inform Interval to CPEs
- Added system parameter for RESET, which is necessary to signal a provisioning of a
TR-069 method called FactoryReset to the CPE. The parameter is treated likewise as the REBOOT
parameter.

- updated UploadAllUnitsToStaging - run a RGW208EN-update
v1.64.2 (2011-06-22)

- added a method to DBI to change Lifetime. Reason: to kill off an old DBI, when shell fires up a new session
- refactored a great deal to allow mass changes of unittype-parameter (both add/change/delete)
v1.64.1 (2011-06-22)
- fixed a bug in GroupParameters.addOrChange(), SQL was wrong
- more work on ParameterDataType
v1.64.0 (2011-06-22) (TABLE CHANGE: group_param: removed is_equal, added operator and data_type)

- added a helper method on Parameter.ParameterDataType to retrieve ParameterDataType
- No testing in this commit
v1.63.1 (2011-06-21)
- Had to revert back to Map instead of Set for the getUnit* methods. Set has no way to retrieve
an indexed element. Thus all the getUnitSet-methods in XAPSUnit had to change name to getUnits()
- Has marked every deprecated method in XAPSUnit and UnitQuery as such, fixed all warnings in this project.
- Tested the changes introduced in v1.63 and refactored xAPS Shell to work flawlessly with it
- Group-parameter searches now handles null-parameter values
- DynamicStatement now support NullString
- DynamicStatement has improved DebugMessage (also prints execution time for sql)
- DBI changed to handle all Group-changes without reloading the entire xAPS object
- The whole DBI is updated to not use any deprecated methods
- Changed some names the new classes: UnitQueryCrossUnittype/UnitQueryWithinUnittype
v1.63.0 (2011-06-20) (Added UnitParameterQuery - very promising replacement for UnitQuery)
- added UnitParameterQuery - will allow the following features:
	- search for units and return unit-parameters in the query/question
	- use comparisons like <,<=, >=, >
	- can auto-convert operands in query from VARCHAR to SIGNED/UNSIGNED int
	- take non-existing unit-parameters into account (correctly handles profile-parameter inheritance)
	- possible to search for "NULL"
	- returns a set of Units, no longer Map which was unnecessary
	Other implications are:
	- possible to add operator to group-parameter, instead of a simple boolean for equality
	- possible to make group-search and advanced search much better
	- a lot of functionality in UnitQuery may now be obsolete, only search for a unit-parameter value is now relevant
- Parameter class is expanded to support Operator enumeration and ParameterDataType enumeration (see features above)
- UnitParameterQuery is not tested very much at this stage
- DynamicStatement got a new method for trimming the sql with a number of characters
v1.62.0 (2011-06-17)  (First version to support Telnet-provisioning)
- Changed "hasDeviceParameters" in UnittypeParameters-class to be computed upon request (and then cached)
- DBI will now refresh Jobs upon PUBLISH_CHG from the Message-system, it will no longer re-read the entire XAPS
- Small rule-change for Job - no parameter allowed for KICK job
- Added TELNET job type to JobFlag
- Added getAllMessages to Inbox, possible for others to see which messages has been processed
- Added 5 new System Parameters: 
	public static final String TELNET_IP = "System.X_OWERA-COM.Telnet.IPAddress";
	public static final String TELNET_PORT = "System.X_OWERA-COM.Telnet.Port";
	public static final String TELNET_USERNAME = "System.X_OWERA-COM.Telnet.Username";
	public static final String TELNET_PASSWORD = "System.X_OWERA-COM.Telnet.Password";
	public static final String TELNET_DESIRED_SCRIPT_VERSION = "System.X_OWERA-COM.Telnet.DesiredScriptVersion";

of how to specify unittypes and profile in XAPSUnit, profile will now override
unittype if necessary.

UnitQuery is now improved a lot to handle multiple profiles or multiple unittypes. 
Tested with 100K units, greatly improved performance over UnitQuery2, now have 
only few seconds response time on queries concerning the whole population. Testlevel
is 40-50% on this class.

v1.47
- Added a new UnitQuery2 class. This class is able to support multiple unittypes and
profiles. The join (between UNIT and UNIT_PARAM) is performed in the application. 
The class is integrated with xAPSUnit and everything should work like before. However,
testing with 100K units make the JOIN-queries slow (20-30sec). It might very well be 
that this attempt will not be used in the future. Consider this a test. To switch back
to previous version, just go back to XAPSUnit of v1.46.23. Might also consider removing
the deprecated statement in UnitQuery.
