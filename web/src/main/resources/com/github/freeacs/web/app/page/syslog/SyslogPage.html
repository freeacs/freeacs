<p>In the Syslog page, there is a lot of flexibility in terms of retrieving and filtering Syslog
messages. The Syslog messages can be retrieved by either entering the Unit name (NB! Write ^YOUR-COMPLETE-UNITID$ to get quick results!),
selecting Unit Type and/or selecting Profile. There is also the possibility of retrieving logs
by selecting a severity level. The severity levels available are: Emergency, Alert, Critical,
Error, Warning, Notice, Info and Debug. These severity levels are in accordance with the
levels defined in the Syslog standard (RFC 3164). By default when you go to Syslog you
are given a simple search form. You can extend this form by going into the
advanced form.</p>

<p>In the advanced version of the Syslog, a lot more fields can be be added to the search
criteria. In the severity list it is possible to select more than one item by holding down
CTRL and clicking the desired severity code, and you use the same procedure for
unchecking the codes. It is possible to search for all fields that the Syslog page displays
in the results. One of these fields, UserId, is per example particularly interesting because
you can search for all changes done by a specific operator (e.g. a login to Web).</p>

<p>The results from the query in the Syslog page will return: Time, Severity, Facility,
EventId, Message, UserId, Hostname, IpAddress, UnitId, Profile and Unit Type. All of
these will give you a complete picture of what has happened, and what person or system
that has initiated the change. An explanation for some of them is required.
Facility describes what kind of system has emitted the Syslog message. If you only need
to see messages emitted by Web, you can do so by choosing it from the drop down
menu.</p>

<p>Event Id is describing what type of content the Syslog message reports. If data has been
written to a CPE or if it has been upgraded, these are event codes that can be searched
for.</p>

<p>The operator must enter a from date to search in the Syslog. That is because the Syslog
database is a huge collection and it would take forever to return all of them to the
browser. Normally the operator will only need a small selection of the Syslog database,
per example within the last 24 hours. When the operator goes to the Syslog page, the
from date will automatically be set to yesterday, making it easier for him to find events
that has occurred lately. To set a date, either use the calendar widget (by clicking the
calendar icon, the keyboard arrows while the date field has focus) or type it in manually.</p>

<p>The format of the date fields is dd-MM-yyyy and it can easily be customized to fit the
customers need.</p>
