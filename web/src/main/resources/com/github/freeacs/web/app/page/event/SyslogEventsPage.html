<h1>Syslog Event</h1>
A Syslog Event is a "action" taken by the server in the event of a special syslog message arriving at the Syslog Server. The use cases
this feature are meant to cover are these:
<ul>
<li>Specifying an event id for certain type of messages - makes it easy to search for these messages on the Syslog page
<li>Making it possible to reduce the number of syslog messages, either by throwing them away or counting and throwing away duplicates.
<li>Run a script upon a certain message - anything is possible with a script!
</ul>
Furthermore, a Syslog Event is a crucial to make a Trigger - all BASIC Triggers must specify a Syslog Event.
