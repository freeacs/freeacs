		<h2>Search page</h2>
		<div>
			<p>There are basically three ways you can search for units on the search page.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>search directly on Unit Id</li> 
				<li>search for matches on all unit parameter values when no Unit Type is selected</li>
				<li>search for matches on a specific profile and unit parameter when Unit Type is selected</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You're allowed to combine Unit Id searches with one of the two other searches.</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			Let's say a customer is calling in reporting strange behaviour with his device.
			You have selected the correct Unit Type, and within that selected Unit Type the SerialNumber parameter is flagged as "searchable" 
			and thus appears on the search page as a searchable parameter. 
			You can then ask the customer to flip his device over and give to you the serial number printed on its bottom. 
			Filling this into the search field for SerialNunber and then hitting Enter will give you one single result, the customers Unit.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can dynamically add parameters to search for by typing the name of a parameter
			in the "Add parameter" field. The system will automatically list all parameters that
			match (partly) and you can choose which parameter you want to use. For permanent searchable 
			parameter fields, go to the Unit Type page and add the "S" flag to the parameter you
			want to search for.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately there is an asymmetry in the search for parameters. The second search mentioned
			will not take into account the profile parmeter values, but the third search will. The difference
			is that if you search for "SIP-Server = 'owera.com'" and this value is a profile parameter value, the
			third search will list all units within this profile (unless it overrides the 'owera.com' with another
			value), but the second will only list those units which explictely have set this value on
			the unit itself. Therefore the second search is mostly for searching after unique unit values like
			Serialnumber (MAC-address), SIP-username, etc.<br />
			The unfortunate thing is that we cannot offer both search method 2 and 3 at the same time.
