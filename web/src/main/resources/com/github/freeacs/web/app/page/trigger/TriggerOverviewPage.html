<h1>Triggers</h1>
A Trigger is somewhat similar to a Syslog Event: it specifies an action to happen based on one or more events. The idea is that
an Operator should be able to specify a Trigger to get information or to act upon one or more events among the devices 
in the pool.

<h2>Basic Trigger</h2>
All Triggers build on top of one or more Syslog Events, so you first have to create a Syslog Event. In other words, Triggers act 
upon messages sent to the system over Syslog. Make sure Trigger type is BASIC.  Then specify an evaluation period between 15 and 120 minutes. The
evaluation period is the time the system counts the number of Syslog Events, and from which units these events are sent. Next specify
how many events must occur, and from how many devices they must come, to release the Trigger.
<p>
At this point you have specified how to release the trigger, but not what to do. There are several things which can happen:
<ul>
<li>Send a notification, either REPORT or ALARM, in which case a notification interval is required (to avoid get swamped in reports/alarms).
<li>Run a script. This script must be a FreeACS shell script where you can perform all sorts of operations, searches, etc. To make the script
even more powerful, the system creates a file with those Unit-ids responsible for the release, and make it possible to use this file
in the script. The filename of this file is retrieved by using ${_1} in the script, and can then be looped over, printed, etc. 
</ul>

<h2>Composite Trigger</h2>
When you have multiple Basic Triggers, it can be valuable to combine them, to do things like "If Syslog Event A happens X times and
Syslog Event B happens Y times, then something should happen". A Composite Trigger can only be release if all it's "child Triggers" is released. 
The child Triggers could be both Composite and Basic.
