<p>To create a shipment you need a list of Serial Numbers. If you get warnings while
creating the new shipment, this might be due to that some of the units are being moved
from one shipment to another. Review this information before you confirm a shipment. If
you get errors while creating the shipment this might be due to that the given Serial
Numbers does not exist for the Product or that necessary system parameters are
missing.</p>
