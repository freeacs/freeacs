	The report page is designed to give an overall view of the devices provisioned by the system.
	There are so many possibilities here, that it will be too much to describe them all,
	but it suffice to say that you should be able to discover almost any anomality which affects
	many devices. In sum this is a executive summary of the total pool of devices.
</p>
<p>
	Currently there are 5 reports available. Each report operates in a similar manner, just
	press "Advanced" to see all the possibilities. 
	First and foremost you can decide upon the Unittype, secondly the Profile. But in many
	cases you may leave the choice to "All unittypes" - at this point you may not know which
	Unittype to focus on.<br>
	You can change the default timespan and also the period type (HOUR, DAY and MONTH). By doing
	so you can decide to look on very long timespans to discover slow trends or zoom in on
	a particular day to find intra-day changes. If you have not already chosen HOUR, you can
	do so by clicking on the line itself, the chart will then zoom in on that particular day.<br>
	The third option is to decide which metric you will examine. Some reports offers a range
	of metric, others just a few. A metric may be "UnitCount" - simply a number which counts
	the number of units.<br>
	Lastly there are checkboxes to check/uncheck. These varies a little for each report, but not
	by much. The idea is that by checking "Unit Type", the chart will change to show one 
	line for each Unit Type that you have chosen (assuming "All unittypes" are chosen). By checking 
	yet another checkbox, like Profile, you will get a chart with one line for each combination
	of Unit Type + Profile. To try to exaplain this a bit more abstract: By checking and 
	unchecking you change the level of aggregation. This will allow you to inspect a problem and
	identify more closely from where the problem arises.<br>  
	
</p>
<p>
	The Unit report tells you a simple status of the number of devices in your system. This is
	pretty basic, but nontheless important. You can easily spot trends like "is the growth tapering
	off?". By using the chekcboxes you can get more information: Check "software version" checkbox and 
	you will see how many units are using each software version you have deployed. Checking
	the "status" checkbox will show you the connect status to the system. It is not a good sign if many 
	devices has not connected for a long time.
</p>
<p>
	The Group report is very simple, just showing the number of units pr group. If you have
	used groups extensively to count the population of certain traits/customers/etc, this report
	is a usefaul progress report.
</p>
<p>
	The job report offers more metrics/counters than Unit and Group report. It will show how many
	failed, how many unconfirmed failed and confirmed failed. There are one aspect here which 
	is not mentioned so far: The interface allows you to choose to metrics at the same time. The
	chart will then show boths metrics at once, the left y-axis for the first metric and the right
	y-axis for the second metric. This is useful to compare to metrics with each other.

<p>
	The voip report is much more complex than the reports mentioned so far. It is also different from
	the beforementioned reports because it gathers all its information from syslog messages. The previous
	reports gathered the information from internal database tables. Since the syslog messages comes 
	directly (for the most part) from the devices, it means that a device must support a specific
	syslog message. Only devices from Ping Communications support this syslog message.
	<br>
	Having said so, this information gives a excellent view over the VoIP situation. The default
	metric is TotalScore which is a number between 0 and 100, 100 is top quality of the 
	service. This score takes into account the quality of each phone call  + the time a phone
	has been out of service (as recorded by the SIP-server). Total score does not take into account
	if the device has been offline, so it is not perfect, but even so it is more than good enough
	to spot trouble areas.<br>
	Explore the various metrics to find more interesting information about the voip service. It can
	often be useful to compare a metric with CallLengthTotal, because then you will see every metric
	up aginst the usage of the service (low score in the middle of the night) might not be a huge problem.
	<br>
	The voip report has extra "zoom". If you click on a line you will zoom into that particular day,
	like the other reports. But if you click yet again you will enter a page (you can also go here
	directly from the leftside menu) which will list all units with calls or voip "trouble" this hour.
	From there you pinpoint if the problems are coming from a small number of units, or if the trouble
	is more widespread. You of course dig down even deeper, that is explained in the help section
	for those pages.
</p>
<p>
	The hardware report is similar to the voip report in the sense that it builds upon a particular
	syslog message emitted from the devices. The intention of the hardware report is to
	give a most accurate picture of hardware-related issues on the devices. At this point in the 
	developement we offer memory statistics and boot-history. Later we might be able to add temperature
	and CPU utilization. Anyhow, this information can be important to detect troubles that
	are exetremely hard to spot on a single device, but rather easy to spot on a large population.
	<br>
	You can zoom in like in the voip report, down to a level where you can identify each device.
