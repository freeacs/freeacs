	In the Profile page, you can create/update/delete Profile and Profile parameters. A Profile
	cannot be created unless a Unit Type has been created first. The Profile will always be
	connected to a single Unit Type. To create a Profile, you have to select the appropriate
	Unit Type and enter the new Profile name. Additionally you may choose to copy
	parameters from an existing Profile.
</p>

<p>
	To delete a Profile, you have to select the appropriate Unit Type and Profile. Beware that
	you cannot delete a Profile if its currently being used. You have to manually delete all
	Units from the Profile, before you are permitted to delete it.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to upgrade the Profile to another Software version, you are able to do so in
	the Links section. You will get a new window where you can select the desired Software
	version, and click upgrade.
</p>

<p>
	A Service Window defines when a Unit can be provisioned. The ACS will inform the CPE
	when it can connect based on this service window. If you want to configure Service
	Window for your Profile (for all Units within this Profile), you are able to do so in the
	Links section. After selecting from day [,to day], from and to time and frequency [1],
	clicking "Update service window" will set the correct parameters in the Profile. See 
	the description on the Unit page for more information about Service Window. 
</p>

<p>
	The set of operations that are available for Profile parameters are: Create, Update and
	Delete. To make it easier to perform operations on a specific Profile parameter or a set of
	parameters, a search field for the parameter name is available. A search can be
	additionally narrowed by selecting the appropriate parameter flag. The operator can also
	choose to see Unconfigured parameters only. Press 'Update parameters' to save newly
	created or updated parameters.<br />
	A profile parameter is usually specified when the parameter is common for many units. Typically
	server-information, desired software version and System parameter are specified.
