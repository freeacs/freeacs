<h1>Job</h1>
<p>
	A Job is the action that you want to perform on a Group. It is important to remember
	that a Job is connected to one Group only. To create a Job, you should select the
	appropriate Unit Type, Job Type, Service Window and Group to get started. See the 
	field help for more information.
</p>

<h2>Dependency</h2>
	Jobs can have a dependency, which means the Jobs will have to wait for the Job
	dependency to complete. Because of this you can make structures of Jobs that will run in
	sequence. This is useful if you need to make a sequence like this: Disable something-Configure-Enable something.
	Another use case might be Reboot-Configure.


<h2>Stop rules</h2>
	You can also set stop rules for the Job, and this is made easy with a GUI that pops up
	when you hit the plus sign on the right side of the input field for the stop rules. These
	settings will help you to define when the Job should stop.

	
<p>
	An example to this is 10 Unconfirmed failed Unit Jobs out of 1000. When you hit the Add
	failure rule it will be converted to u10/1000 in the text field. An unconfirmed failure 
	is when the device never returns to the server after a change has been issued. This is
	considered a very dangerous situation - it might indicate that the change cause the device
	to loose connection. The other type of failure is Confirmed failure which means that
	the device rejected the change with an error message. The idea is that a Job can
	stop automatically when a certain condition arises.
</p>

<h2>Job states</h2>
	To start the Job, hit the START button. 
	Note that you cannot change any parameters set if the Job has been started, so make
	sure you have everything set correct before you start the Job. You can at any time pause
	the job, and then restart it. 


<h2>Repeat Jobs</h2>
	Certain jobs may be necessary to run more than once. To do so set the repeat-counter to
	a positive number (number of repeats) and set the repeat interval to a number of seconds.
	This interval will override (if necessary) the default spread interval decided by
	the service window. However, the job will still work within the service window.


<h2>Job parameters</h2>
	The job parameters tell the job what the change is all about. Here you specify what actually
	should be configured on the device. If you choose Job type to be SOFTWARE, then you will 
	only be allowed to set DesiredSoftwareVersion. Other rules apply for other job types.
