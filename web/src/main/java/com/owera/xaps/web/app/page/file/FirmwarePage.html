			In the Software page, you can Create/Update/Delete Softwares. In order to add a
			one, first select an appropriate Unit Type, enter the name,
			description, version number, browse for the binary file and finally upload the Software to
			the database. The version field is important as the contents of this field will be used in the actual upgrade process later.
			Typically, the version field should contain the exact name of the Software as instructed
			by the provider, including case-sensitivity and punctuation. The name field is an internal
			identifier for the given Software, and could be anything.

			Export the Softwares you need to inspect by clicking the link for the desired Software. 
			If you want to edit a specific Software, and delete
			another, you can do this in one step. Check the delete box, change the name and
			description of the other Software and hit "Save changes". You can also change the
			Software date, click the calendar icon and select a new date and hit "Save changes".
