			In the Unit Page, the operator can create/update/delete Unit and Unit parameters. The
			Unit is actually a representation of a single device, such as a CPE or a mobile
			phone. To create a Unit, the operator has to select the appropriate Unit Type and Profile,
			and enter the new Unit Id. It is always possible to move an existing Unit from one Profile
			to another Profile. If you create a new Unit, then the Unit Id must conform with the protocols
			Unit Id format. <br/>
			For TR-069 this is &lt;OUI&gt;-&lt;Product Class&gt;-&lt;Serialnumber&gt;.
			OUI is a 6-digit number identifying the manufacturer of the device. Product Class is a 
			string identifying the model of the device. SerialNumber is usually the MAC address of the
			device. <br/>
		</p>
		<p>
			To delete a particular Unit, find the Unit with the search page. Units cannot be deleted by
			accident. Whenever the operator click a delete button, the operator will be asked to
			confirm the delete.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If the Administrator want to upgrade the Unit to another Software version, it is
			possible to do so from the Links section on the Unit page. The Administrator will get
			a new window where the desired Software version can be selected from a drop down
			menu, and by clicking upgrade the upgrade process will begin the next time the unit is
			provisioned. The Administrator can also change the Unit he wants to upgrade, by
			typing a part of the Unit id, and he will get a list of Units that matches.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If the operator want to configure Service Window for the Profile, it is possible to do so
			from the Links section. After selecting from day [,to day], from and to time and
			frequency, clicking "Update service window" will set the correct parameters in the
			Unit. These settings will override Profile service windows. The idea of a Service Window
			is that you can control when the device will connect to the server. Maybe you only want
			provisioning to happen during daytime on working days - that can be specified. But
			it might also be that you will specify a lower load on the system, by changing the frequncy
			from 7 times pr week (default) to 2 times pr week. <br />
			Actually there are two Service Windows: One for the regular/standard provisioning, and one
			for provisioning that disrupts the service. If you specify a firmware upgrade or a scheduled
			reboot, it is the Disruptive Service Window that decideds when the provisioning will happen, 
			otherwise it is the Regular Service Window that decides.<br/>
			Another point worth mentioning about Service Window is "spread". Setting the  
			frequency to 7 (time pr week), is not to say that the device will connect every 24h. It will 
			connect *on average* every 24h, but it might vary with many hours either way. This is
			to ensure that a power outage in a major city will not cause many devices to cause a peak
			in the load of your system.

			In the Unit parameters listing, the operator will get a list containing all the Unit
			parameters and all the Profile parameters. If a parameter has both a Profile value and a
			Unit value, the latter takes precedence over the former. There are in general two types
			of parameters: System parameters and Device parameters. The System parameters name is prefixed
			"System" and the Device parameters are prefixed "InternetGatewayDevice" or "Device".<br />
			The Device parameters can be read or written from the device. If a parameter is a
			Read-Only parameter, it can be retrieved from the device - but never written to the device.
			A Read-Write parameter can be written to the device, but not read from the device.
			So by setting values in the Read-Write parameters you decide what to provision to the
			device. For more information about the flags governing the behaviour of a parameter, read
			the Unit Type help section. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If the operator needs to configure some SIP parameters, use the filter section to look
			these up. By default, when no unit parameters are defined, 
			"Status" is set to "All" which means that both "Unconfigured" and
			"Configured" unit parameters are displayed at the same time. If
			some unit parameters are configured, then the status will be set "Configured". If SIP
			parameters is not set and there are other unit parameters configured, you will not be
			able to see the SIP parameters unless you change "Status" to "All" or "Unconfigured".
			There are other filters: Name filter (just type part of the parameter name) and type
			filter (read-only, system parameter, etc). Use this filter to quickly find the parameters
			you want to examine/edit.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Inspection mode is a possibility only if the unit in question is on public IP (not
			connected behind a router) and if the protocol in use is TR-069. If that is the case
			you can connect to it by chaning to Inspection mode. In this mode you can inspect
			all parameters with the "I" flag set (see Unit Type page). You can also change parameter
			values on-the-fly and therefore quickly fix any problems that the customer might experience.
			You can probably achieve the same result on units that doesn't comply to these
			requirements, but then the customer will need to restart his/her device to get started,
			possibly also each time you want to perform a change or a new read on the device.
			All in all, Inspection mode is not very useful at this moment, but future development
			will make things more convenient.
