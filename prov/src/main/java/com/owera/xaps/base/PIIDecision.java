/**
 * This class should be the final decision maker on the next Periodic 
 * Inform Interval (PII). The following logic is applied:
 * 
 * Minimum PII set from this class is 31 because the minimum PII that a client 
 * can accept (according to spec) is 30.
 * 
 * If a job is in progress or the status of a job is COMPLETED_OK, PII = 31. The reason
 * is that the client must return a soon as possible to check for job verification
 * or to see if more jobs are waiting.
 * 
 * In case no job is in progress or not COMPLETED_OK we can assume that either no job
 * was found or the job had completed with status CONFIRMED_FAILED or UNCONFIRMED_FAILED.
 * In all these cases we treat the situation as no job was found.
 * 
 * If "no job found", find all jobs scheduled to run in future and calculate the next PII.
 * Additionally, if a disruptive parameter (SOFTWARE/SCRIPT/REBOOT/RESET) has been set,
 * calculate the next PII according to Disruptive Service Window. Choose the lowest PII
 * as next PII.
 * 
 * If no future job is found, and no disruptive parameter set, calculate PII according
 * to Regular Service Window.
 * 
 * Necessary information
 * 
 * 1. Current job (if any) and status of job (if available)
 * 2. All jobs with calculated nextPII
 * 3. Time stamp for calculation of nextPII (to offset final nextPII)
 * 4. Disruptive Service Window (if disruptive parameter set)
