v1.4.28 (2015-01-25)
- del: Removed FileServlet - it had to be moved back to SPP/TR069 servers (and duplicated), since authentication had to be added.
v1.4.27 (2013-08-22)
- ref: Handles a CURRENT_JOB which is non-existent (recently deleted)
v1.4.26 (2013-08-14)

v1.4.24 (2013-06-10)
- bug: JobType CONFIG did not work, since job-params were set to late (after GPV-response had been received). Moved the section from UnitJob.start() into
TR069-servers GPVDecision.prepareSPVForConfigJob(). This will also require some change in SPP (which have not been done yet - and maybe never will?)

v1.3.7 (2012R1) (2012-01-18)
- imp: Added/changed some comments
- ref: Allows repeatInterval of a job at 0 or more (before 120 or more), improved calculation of nextRunTms
- bug: The nextPII calculated for a future job leaked over to other sessions, a cleanup was required om PIIDecision
v1.3.6 (2012R1) (2011-12-27)
- allows TR-069 ACS username to deviate from standard and not containing OUI (will break if swithcing between auth-mode and none-auth-mode)
v1.3.5 (2012R1) (2011-12-15)
- refactor: changed from 120 sec session-hang to 600 sec (to avoid wolf, wolf-situation)
- refactor: changed from Set to Map in ThreadCounter.ipSet, since we need to keep track of number of connections from each IP
- bugfix: OK-servlet did not check on high ThreadCounter  
- bugfix: group-parameter matching against unit-paramete002194-NPA201E-0021940012AC
v1.3.4 (2012R1) (2011-12-13)
- improve: Monitoring of sessions that never ends
v1.3.3 (2012R1) (2011-12-12)
- improve: OK-servlet also checks for DBI-errors
v1.3.2 (2012R1) (2011-12-07) 
- bugfix: reset-parameter was written (as "1") after a reset-job
- refactor: removed logging
v1.3.1 (2012R1) (2011-12-06)
- refactor: improved monitoring of connection pool
v1.3.0 (2012R1) (2011-11-28)
- better logging to follow the flow of the logic
- added PIIDecision - necessary to compute correct PII, this has always been buggy before,
but never really discovered, since most people didn't use Jobs at all (and if they did, they
would not discover the wrong PII anyway). The problem would be much more prominent with
repeatable jobs.
- major refactoring of both JobLogic and ServiceWindow (two of the more complicated classes)
	these classes should be easier to read, and I also believe more robust, less error-prone
- small change to allow UnitJob to be started by either server-side jobs, or client-side jobs
- added support for job type RESET (= Factory Reset)
- JobLogic bugfix - now checks for ServiceWindow & DownloadAllowed before in correct order
v1.2.1a (2011R1) (2011-06-23)
- updated to xaps-dbi v1.64.3
v1.2.1 (2011-06-20)
- improved on unit-job stop, now sets the timestamp of the job-start
(more correct timing of the repeating jobs)
v1.2.0a (2011-06-17)
- refactored away from OweraParameters in one single place
v1.2.0 (2011-06-17)
- updated FileServlet to parse for file-type in URL -> more accurate
- changed UnitJob from static to instance -> changes also in JobLogic
- changed UnitJob to handle TelnetProvisioning as well
v1.1.2 
- fixed CPEParameters so it supports a quirk for config-file-version
- fixed Properties so it downloads correct property file. A bug was introduced in v1.0.0
v1.1.1
- fixed FileServlet so it can also download SCRIPT-files
v1.1.0 
- updated project according to changes added in the TR-069 project since the
split between xAPS SPP and xAPS TR-069.
- also made some minor refactoring to make the split complete
v1.0.0
- these packages are moved from xapsspp v1.2.0, but modified slightly. Expect 
minor modification when introducing this jar-file back into xAPS SPP
